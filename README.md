## Activate / Deactivate via Launch Files

### Playstation Bluetooth Controller

In the past we had scary behavior when we were first using the Playstation controller and then the ELRS RC controller. To avoid this we deactivate the Playstation controller by default. If you want to use it, you can activate it in the launch file [jackal_control/launch/teleop.launch](jackal_control/launch/teleop.launch) by uncommenting all uncommented lines.

We now use the ELRS RC controller by default.
